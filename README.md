# kanboard-ng

Rework of the well known PHP based  Kanban Board Kanboard.

### why rework
Kanboard is original base on PHP5 and at maintenance mode. This means no new feautures, only small bug fixes.

### what will be renewed
Kanboard-NG have to be based on a newer, actuall, Framework. This Framework will be  probable CodeIgniter4, because of native multiple Database Support for postgres, sqlite and mysqli.

Additionaly will Kanboard-NG use native gettext for Translations instead of the original PHP Array.
